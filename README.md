<h1 align="center">Study case 1: Code </h1>

## 1. Description of the Process

This repository contains the code necessary to download amino acid chains from the National Center for Biotechnology Information through its Application Programming Interface (API), save them in files in a dataake and in a pandas dataframe in csv format. These are then used to try to classify the types of proteins using unsupervised learning techniques. Finally, conclusions are obtained that will be developed soon and it provides an API to be able to train the data with the hyperparameters that the user considers.

## 3. Encoding the data

In the context of unsupervised learning, it is essential to encode the data in such a way that the models can operate efficiently with it. In this study, a variation of the Bag of Words method has been implemented, as this approach does not consider the order of amino acid chains, which is a critical factor in protein classification.

The function $\alpha(i,n)$ takes care of calculating a weight for each position $i$ in an amino acid sequence of length $n$, assigning a higher value to amino acids appearing at the beginning of the sequence and gradually decreasing towards the end.

The first proposed encoding consists of a vector whose length is determined by the get_vector_byMaxN method, which initialises a vector of zeros with a length equal to the total number of possible amino acids. Subsequently, each amino acid in the sequence is traversed, determining its position in the vector by means of a dictionary that associates amino acids with indices. The corresponding value in the vector is then incremented by multiplying it by the weight calculated by $\alpha$, where $N$ represents the maximum length of a chain in the datalake.

The second proposed encoding is similar to the first, with the exception that $N$ depends on the length of each amino acid chain.

Both encodings allow capturing the distribution of amino acids in the sequence, weighting the importance of their position for further analysis.

To understand both encodings more clearly, the following example is given. Suppose you have three amino acid chains: ABA, BBB and ABABB. It may happen that the first and third chains are of the same type, as they have a similar sequence. The procedure using both encodings is detailed below.
- A dictionary is defined with the positions of each amino acid: `dict_positions = {A: 0, B: 1}`
   
1. First encoding: The maximum length of the strings is taken for the calculation: `n = max(length) = ababb = 5`
The strings encoded using this first encoding are as follows:
    - ABA: $\[1 \times \frac{(5-0)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-2)}{5}, 1 \times \frac{(5-1)}{5}\] = [1.6, 0.8]$
    - BBB: $\[0, 1 \times \frac{(5-0)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-1)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-2)}{5}\]  = [0, 2.4]$
    - ABABB: $\[1 \times \frac{(5-0)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-2)}{5}, 1 \times \frac{(5-1)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-3)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-4)}{5}\]  = [1.6, 1.4]$

In this coding, the cosine similarity matrix is as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/cosine-matrix-1.svg" width = "250" >
</p>

2. Second encoding: In this encoding, the length is taken according to the length of the string to be encoded.
    - ABA: $\[1 \times \frac{(3-0)}{3} + 1 \times \frac{(3-2)}{3}, 1 \times \frac{(3-1)}{3}\] = [1.33, 0.66]$
    - BBB: $\[0, 1 \times \frac{(3-0)}{3} + 1 \times \frac{(3-1)}{3} + 1 \times \frac{(3-2)}{3}\]  = [0, 2] $
    - ABABB: $\[1 \times \frac{(5-0)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-2)}{5}, 1 \times \frac{(5-1)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-3)}{5} + 1 \times \frac{(5-4)}{5}\]  = [1.6, 1.4] $

In this coding, the cosine similarity matrix is as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/cosine-matrix-2.svg" width="250">
</p>

Therefore, both similarity matrices reflect the high relationship between the first and third chains.

## 4. Analysis of results

In this study, the DBSCAN algorithm and K-means have been applied to each of the encodings. Firstly, it is noted that the DBSCAN algorithm is highly sensitive to hyperparameters, which results in an unclear visualisation of the clusters when using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as shown in Figure 2. Despite this, the mean cosine similarity of each cluster is found to be considerably high, as presented in Figure 3.

</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

On the other hand, the elbow method has been implemented to determine the optimal number of k clusters before applying the K-means algorithm. The latter has shown an effective partitioning of the data, as can be seen in the PCA visualisation in Figure 4. Additionally, the similarities of the average cosine of the clusters turn out to be quite high, as indicated in Figure 5.

Finally, this classification should be checked with an expert who will indicate which protein group is being classified.

## 5.How to use the Aplication Programing Interface (API)

To make this project available to the public, an API has been developed using Flask, a Python web framework. The API allows users to cluster proteins based on the parameters they provide. There are two endpoints available:

- **GET Method**: the GET method retrieves a serialized JSON object containing the amino acid sequence and the cluster to which it belongs to. After executing the following command, the user will receive a JSON object with the data.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/proteins-classification/data"
```

Result:

```json
{
    'data': 
        [
            {
                'cluster': 0,
                'sequence':'GGGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVS...'
            }, 
            {
                'cluster': 1, 
                'sequence': 'MVEKGPEVSGKRRGRNNAAASASAAAASAAAA...'
            },
            ...,
            {
                'cluster': -1, 
                'sequence': 'MVEKGPEVSGKRRGRNNAAASASAAAASAAAA...'
            }
        ]
}
```	

- **POST Method**: the POST method allows the user to send a JSON object with the parameters to cluster the proteins. The user will be provided with a JSON object containing such parameters that will be used by clustering algorithms.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/proteins-classification/data -d '{"eps": 0.5, "min_samples": 5}'
```

The result obtained is similar to the one shown above.


## 6. Technologies

To tackle this problem, the following technologies have been used:

- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It's been extremely useful for clustering the proteins based on their amino acid sequences, since it offers a wide range of clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN and K-means, the ones used in this study.

- **Pandas**: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It has been used to store the amino acid sequences into a DataFrame, allowing manipulation and analysis of the data.

- **Flask**: A lightweight web application framework that is designed with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It has been used to create the API that allows users to cluster proteins based on their amino acid sequences, as explained in the previous section.

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks have been used to develop the code, as they provide an interactive environment for data analysis and visualization. They have been extremely useful for testing and debugging the code, as well as for visualizing the results obtained.

<h1 align="center">Study case 2: Architecture</h1>

## 1. Introduction

<p align="justify">
The human being needs proteins to survive all the time.  These are obtained from our body's DNA which goes through a process to synthesise amino acids to build the necessary proteins. As data scientist, the classification of this protein according to its amino acid chain was not known from the outset and so, in collaboration with the team of biologists from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, an application has been made that will be a language model that you give the amino acid chain and it will tell you what protein it is or even what protein it is close to.
</p>

## 2. Architecture

<p align="justify">
DeepAmino, the aforementioned model, is a PLM that is able to predict protein characteristics given its amino acid sequence. To deploy such a tool so that clients all around the world are able to make use of it, we introduce the following architecture. As can be seen in <b>Diagram 1</b>, the whole infrastructure is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage the cloud's scalability, availability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS allows us to take advantage of economies of scale by paying only for the resources used (OpEx), rather than investing in upfront infrastructure (CapEx).

### Key Components:

#### **Amazon S3** 
- **Purpose:** Data Storage and Model Management  
- Amazon S3 is used to store two main types of data:
    1. **Training Data:** The large datasets of amino acid sequences and protein data needed for training the machine learning model. The **training data bucket** will store incoming data from various sources, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), facilitating further processing.
    2. **Model Outputs:** The trained models are stored and accessed via another S3 bucket, encouraging seamless versioning and updating. It will be useful to deploy real-time applications in which AI models are all the time training in batches. Once a model has been trained by the **SageMaker Trainer** service, it is uploaded to the bucket, creating an event which triggers the SageMaker Trainer service for the output model parameters

#### **Amazon SageMaker**
Training and Prediction. Amazon SageMaker is a **fully managed machine learning service** that allows developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and easily. It removes the heavy lifting associated with the infrastructure, so you can focus on developing the model. 

With SageMaker, you can:
1. **Train**: It simplifies training by providing pre-configured environments and optimized infrastructure for distributed training, which allows for efficient resource use when working with large datasets.
2. **Deploy**: Once the model is trained, SageMaker allows for seamless deployment in production, providing a scalable inference endpoint. The endpoint can handle a high volume of requests, making it ideal for real-time prediction tasks.
3. **Manage**: SageMaker provides tools to monitor model performance and automatically scale resources to handle varying workloads.

We will have two SageMaker services that accomplish the following tasks.
- **SageMaker Trainer:** Used for building, training, and fine-tuning the protein classification models. As explained in the code, and in Study Case 1, the trained model is a DBscan model that is able to cluster the proteins according to their amino acid sequence. The model is trained on the data directly obtained from ncbi API, and the output model is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. Also, a new register is created into DynamoDB with the metadata of the model, such as the model name, the model version, the model location, and the model creation date, so that the model can be easily retrieved and deployed in the future.

- **SageMaker Predictor:** Deployed to serve inference requests once the model has been trained and validated, allowing predictions based on amino acid sequences provided by the users. The model is loaded from the Amazon S3 bucket and detected via an AWS SNS event, which triggers the SageMaker Predictor service to load the model and create an endpoint for inference requests. The endpoint is then used to predict the protein classification based on the input sequence.
    
#### **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Purpose:** Database for protein sequences. Each protein amino acid sequence obtained from the **ncbi API** has been also saved into a DynamoDB Table, which helps the **SageMaker Trainer** service to train the model with processed data. The table is named **Protein-sequences**..

**Protein-sequences** stores the name-sequence pairs. This doesn't lead to redundancy, even though the same sequences, including some other relevant metadata, have already been loaded to the Amazon S3. The DynamoDB table is used to store the sequences in a structured way, allowing for quick lookups and responses to users' queries. The table is also used to store the results of the predictions made by the **SageMaker Predictor** service, facilitating quick lookups and responses to users' queries, apart from the mentioned utilities.

#### **Amazon EC2**
- **Purpose:** Computing Resources. EC2 instances are used to run general-purpose computation tasks, such as pre-processing the data received from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and orchestrating requests between services. The EC2 instance is also the one in charge of storing the retrieved data from the NCBI API into the **Protein-sequences** DynamoDB table and into the **Data Lake** S3 bucket.
  
#### **Amazon API Gateway**
- **Purpose:** Serve as a unified interface for clients. API Gateway works as the interface between users and the backend system. It accepts HTTP requests, authenticates them using Amazon Cognito, and routes them to the appropriate services. In this case of study, it is used to provide the results of the protein classification into a cluster of proteins, based on the amino acid sequence provided by the user.

#### **Amazon Cognito**
- **Purpose:** User Authentication. Cognito handles authentication and user management for secure access. Users are authenticated via Cognito before being allowed to interact with the system, ensuring secure access to sensitive bioinformatics data.

#### **Classic Load Balancer**
- **Purpose:** Traffic Distribution  
- The Classic Load Balancer is used to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple EC2 instances and SageMaker endpoints, ensuring that the system remains responsive even under high load.

#### **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- **Purpose:** Network Security. A VPC is used to securely isolate the DeepAmino architecture in the cloud. Sensitive operations, such as training and storage, are housed in the **private subnet**, while public-facing services like API Gateway and Cognito are housed in the **public subnet**.
  
## 3. Workflow

The workflow of the DeepAmino architecture can be seen from two different perspectives: the training workflow and the prediction workflow.

### Training Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The EC2 instance retrieves protein amino acid sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) API and stores them in the **Protein-sequences** DynamoDB table and the **Data Lake** S3 bucket.

2. **Model Training**: The **SageMaker Trainer** service reads the amino acid sequences from the **Protein-sequences** DynamoDB table, trains the DBscan model, and stores the output model in the **Model Outputs** S3 bucket. The metadata of the model is stored in the **Protein-sequences** DynamoDB table.

3. **Model Deployment**: The **AWS SNS** service from **Protein-sequences** table triggers the **SageMaker Predictor** service to load the trained model from the **Model Outputs** S3 bucket and create an endpoint for inference requests. The endpoint is used to predict the protein classification based on the input sequence.

### Prediction Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user provides an amino acid sequence to the **Amazon API Gateway**.

2. **Authentication**: The **Amazon Cognito** service authenticates the user before allowing them to interact with the system.

3. **Prediction**: The **Amazon API Gateway** forwards the amino acid sequence to the **SageMaker Predictor** service, which uses the trained model to predict the protein classification.

4. **Response**: The **SageMaker Predictor** service returns the predicted protein classification to the user via the **Amazon API Gateway**.
